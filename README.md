# NYT Best Seller List analysis

This is an exam project for the course of computational literacy, analysing the NYT Best Seller lists. 

## How to reproduce the analysis

### Data acquisition
First, you'll have to create an API key for the NYT Books API: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview
Then, you can retrieve the lists you want by the python scripts provided here. You can change the time period or the lists you want to get by modifying the code.
Finally, (explore and) convert the json dictionaries into csv files with the jupyter notebook.

### Analysis
The analysis was conducted in Rstudio and, the (quite messy) RMarkdown files are provided on this repository.

### Results
My results can be found in the attached exampaper.pdf
